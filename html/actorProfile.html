					Cumberbatch attended boarding schools from the age of 8; he was educated at Brambletye School in
					West Sussex and was an arts scholar at Harrow School. He was a member of The Rattigan Society,
					Harrow's principal club for the dramatic arts, which was named after Old Harrovian and playwright
					Terence Rattigan. He was involved in numerous Shakespearean works at school and made his acting
					debut as Titania, Queen of the Fairies, in A Midsummer Night's Dream when he was 12. Cumberbatch's
					drama teacher, Martin Tyrell, called him "the best schoolboy actor" he had ever worked with.

					After leaving Harrow, Cumberbatch took a gap year to volunteer as an English teacher at a Tibetan
					monastery in Darjeeling, India. He then attended the Victoria University of Manchester (now the
					University of Manchester), where he studied Drama. He continued his training as an actor at the
					London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA) graduating with an MA in Classical Acting. On 16
					January 2018, it was announced that Cumberbatch would succeed Timothy West as President of LAMDA. On
					being appointed Cumberbatch stated it would be "an honour to watch the next generation of actors,
					directors and technicians blossom".

					he used a suit and facial markers to highlight the dragon's expressions and movements. Cumberbatch
					told Total Film "You just have to lose your shit on a carpeted floor, in a place that looks a little
					bit like a mundane government building. It was just me as well, with four static cameras and all the
					sensors."

					While in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005, Cumberbatch and two friends ("Theo and Denise
					[Black]) were abducted, after bursting a tyre, and held at gunpoint by a group of locals. Eventually
					their abductors drove them into unsettled territory and set them free without explanation.
					Cumberbatch said of the incident: "It taught me that you come into this world as you leave it, on
					your own. It's made me want to live a life less ordinary." Before the burst tyre, they had been
					listening to “How to Disappear Completely” from Radiohead. Following this experience, whenever
					Cumberbatch hears the song it "reminds of a sense of reality [... and] a reason for hope".<br><br>He
					subscribes to Buddhist philosophy and has expressed affinity for meditation and mindfulness.
					Cumberbatch also follows a vegan diet.<br><br>Cumberbatch is married to English theatre and opera
					director Sophie Hunter. Their engagement was announced in the "Forthcoming Marriages" section of The
					Times on 5 November 2014, after a 17-year friendship. On 14 February 2015, the couple married at the
					12th-century Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Mottistone on the Isle of Wight followed by a
					reception at Mottistone Manor. They have two sons, Christopher Carlton (b. 2015) and Hal Auden (b.
					2017).
